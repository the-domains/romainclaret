# My Portfolio

Here I am talking about the projects I have done (it doesn't mean I have finished them).

> Note that I am still working on my portfolio, projects and descriptions are still missing. I will update as soon as I have time, and I don't have a lot of free time :-(

## Now let's see some projects I can talk about :)
