I made a "book" version for my Portfolio. It's somewhat complete. :) 

[PDF Portfolio][0]

Here I am talking about the projects I have done (it doesn't mean I have finished them). 
> 
> Note that I am still working on my digital portfolio (this page or maybe another one), projects and descriptions are still missing. I will update as soon as I have time, and I don't have a lot of free time :-(

Now let's see some projects I can talk about :)

My public codes can be found on [Github/rocla][1].

James Gouin (Qt)

Differential Equations Solver (Java)

## The startup started to build

Libacy

## Otherwise, I have some websites (except this one)

[Rocla.ch][2] / [RoclaMatrix.org][3]

[MyNeotopia.com][4]

[MyArc.ch][5]
