Here you can find here almost anything about my professional life in a more or less informal way. My curriculum vitae, portfolio, activities (I went there or there, talked about that or that, etc...). Well.. To be short, I am occupying this space of the world wide web to reference who I am and what I do.

If you are looking to find out what are my believes, dreams, passions, or how I imagine our future, I have a website featuring those: [MyNeotopia][0]

Or if you want to discover in my points of interests (news, products, videos, books, etc...), you can either read my [feed of interests][1] (which is some sort of my personal bookmark) or follow me on [Twitter][2], or [Linkedin][3].
